#to-do list:

#check into days with no protests: were there really no protests over Christmas 2017, or did they 
#just not enter data?

#fix mis-capitalized states (Hi, Fl, Mi)

#figure out where "Fredon Township" is

#take out non-50-state protests, although I do love SPACE PROTEST

#investigate splitting up locations by counting commas in the string, then extracting state (before
#last comma) and city (after second-to-last comma)

#figure out how what to do with separate topic and position tags in analysis

#AUDIT

#consider spotlight analysis: how disproportionate is the coverage (# of articles)
#for certain places? of course, this doesn't cover protests that only have one
#article written about them!
